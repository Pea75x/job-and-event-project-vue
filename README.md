# Jobhunter

### Technologies used

- Vue.js

The aim of this project is to search for available jobs in London based on your chosen programing language/framework. It includes a pie chart of the most popular skills needed from all of the roles, to give you an idea of what skills would be useful to learn or of upcoming trends.

I was able to collect this data by webscraping using Beautiful Soup and Django. Please have a look at my [backend repo](https://github.com/Pea75x/job-and-event-project) for details
